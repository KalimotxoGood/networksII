1. INTRODUCTION
___________________________________________________________________________

This program takes in a text file and seed as input in the following format:

./runprogram 3 file.txt 

In this case 3 is the seed and file.txt is the filename 
The text file consist of integers that will represent nodes in a graph. There are two functions that deal with the beginning of this. The functions include fileToGraph and GraphToFile. 

The nodes are then created in a graph of Links and Routers with edge weights (bandwidth and delay)

The links are randomly created as well as the bandwidth and delay.

Once the nodes are created, Depth First Search is run to ensure the connectivity of the graph. If the DFS function fails, links are added until the graph is connected. The graph must be connected for the simulation to work.

2. Pairs and Link Structures

______________________________________________________________


The Link data structure uses uniform real distribution to randomly set the bandwidth and delay.
Each link has a setBD and getBD(bandwidth+delay), which equals the total costs. We use the total cost later 
For Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. We randomly selected 20 source-destinations pairs in the file to begin generatin
And transmitting traffic.

3. Router/node structure & Packet

____________________________________________________________


Each node or router will keep track of a routing table that is calculated by DijkstraÕs algorithm for 
The minimum cost from a source a to destination b. Once this is calculated, each node stores itÕs next best hop 
To determine where to send the packets out of. 

The Packet structure consists of types, time, and destination fields. We also use the size of a packet to calculate
Its time to travel from node a to b 

Each router has an input and output queue which queues 30 packets at once and determines time by packetsize/bandwidth and delay

4. Time simulation

____________________________________________________

Time the simulator runs in a for loop of 1,000 seconds, and generates information such as the total number
Of packets generated, total number of packets that have reached, and average packet transmission time. 

For each second of time here, all events are processed within that loop.

The 'seed' used in the generator engines is 3. This should produce the same results from every machine.
